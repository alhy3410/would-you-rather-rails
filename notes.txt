When first start,

bundle

rake db:create

rake db:migrate

go into psql and then upload the csv file into postgres but it should automatically insert all questions
"COPY questions FROM '/Users/Guest/Desktop/would-you-rather-rails/additionalfiles/questions.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV;"

This will give you 36 questions for the project
